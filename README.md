I'm a proficient and detailed-oriented Backend Developer, having 1.5+ years professional experience as a backend engineer. I have clear logical mind with a practical and optimistic approach to problem-solving with drive to see things in their complete state. 

Over the years, I've acquired quality experience in implementing modern software architecture/design, particularly web services, RESTful APIs, microservice architecture, and monolithic architecture e.t.c. In all, I love working with team whose emphasis on industry best practices are prioritized.
